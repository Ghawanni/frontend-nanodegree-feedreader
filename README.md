# Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Proejct #4

### In this project I got introduced to:
- JS unit testing 
- implementing tests for a website's frontend
- using Jasmine framework to write test suites/cases
- how to deal with async functions when testing
- programming with a test-driven approach

-----

Most of the work has been done in `/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` file. 
It shows all the different test suites, and within the test cases and the comments illustrate what each test case does.


### Running the project
All files needed to run the project are included (no need for `npm i` or anything).
All you have to to is downlaod/clone the project, run a liveserver on the directory of which you downlaoded the project
and walla! you got the project running with the SpecRunner showing the test case results on the buttom of the page.
