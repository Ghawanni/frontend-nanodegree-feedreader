# Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Proejct #4

### In this project I got introduced to:
- JS unit testing 
- implementing tests for a website's frontend
- using Jasmine framework to write test suites/cases
- how to deal with async functions when testing
- programming with a test-driven approach

-----

Most of the work has been done in `/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` file. 
It shows all the different test suites, and within the test cases and the comments illustrate what each test case does.
